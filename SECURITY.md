## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Fidiora, we take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Lightweight Cookie Consent project, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities through our dedicated security email:
**security@fidiora.com**

You can also report non-critical security issues through our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Fidiora/lightweight-cookie-consent/issues).

### What to Include

When reporting vulnerabilities, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

After you report a vulnerability:

1. You'll receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours
2. We'll investigate and keep you updated on our findings
3. Once validated, we'll develop and test a fix
4. We'll notify you when the fix is ready
5. After deploying the fix, we'll publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure

### Disclosure Policy

- Please give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
- Please only interact with your own accounts or test accounts for security research purposes

### Safe Harbor

Fidiora supports responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not take legal action against you or administrative action against your account if you make a good faith effort to follow our disclosure policy
- We will acknowledge your contribution if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and we make a code or configuration change based on it
